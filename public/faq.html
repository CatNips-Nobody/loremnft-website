    {question:"Are you sure?", answer:"Yes.", isopen:false, isreadmore:false, readmorelink:""},
    {question:"Has cat nips taken over and is now seeking revenge?", answer:"No, the founders have unanimously agreed without harming each other.", isopen:false, isreadmore:false, readmorelink:""},
    {question:"Then why?", answer:"With a Bull's Pride and a Bear's Awareness, we want to do our part in the sustainability of a most beloved NFT space--and fucking--HAVE FUN!!!", isopen:false, isreadmore:false, readmorelink:""},
    {question:"What is so special about the LOREM CC0 Treasury?",answer:"We wish to embrace non-owners as part of our community. There will be 100 pre-reveal NFTs locked into the Treasury forever, and these NFTs will be made CC0. This will enable anyone, holders and non-holders alike, to benefit from the project in creating their own derivatives and projects while retaining full commercial and creative rights. Holders of the remaining non-Treasury NFTs will retain full commercial and creative rights.", isopen:false, isreadmore:true, readmorelink:"https://twitter.com/LOREMNFT/status/1540364300157845504"},

    {question:"How does the Resident Nomination system work?", answer:"Residents will each gain the opportunity to invite 5 of their trusted friends and associates to join the LOREM world as Initiates.

    {question:"How can I earn my spot on the Allowlist?", answer:"Regularly, Residents will nominate Initiates to gain access to a Rystal for AL. Initiates will be nominated based on their quality of engagement, investment in the lore and a genuine connection with the rest of the community. There are no level systems here, so spam messaging will likely not yield the best result. We've been running this for the past month or so.",isopen:false,isreadmore:false, readmorelink:""},
